This problem is actually the well known cop-win game so all you have to do is to check if the 
given graph is dismantlable. By definition, a graph is dismantlable if it has a dismantling
order which can be found with the following algorithm:
 
A node X is said to be dominated by a node Y if X and Y are adjacent and the list of 
neighbors of X is included in the list of neighbors of Y
 
Let G be the initial graph

while (|G| > 1)
|   find a suitable node X which is dominated by one of it's neighbors
|    
|   if (X has been found) 
|       G <-- G - <X>
|   else
|       G is not dismantlable

if (|G| == 1)
    G is dismantlable
